This project is more of a challenge to myself.

I'm a computer engineering student and I love computer graphics, so I thought I would try to build my own engine using C++ and OpenGL.

This project aims to be fully-functional and easy-to-use, if it'll grow enough I'll make a documentation... at the moment you can just look at code and figure out yourself how it works.

Hope you enjoy!
